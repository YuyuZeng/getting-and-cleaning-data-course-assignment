This is prepared for the course getting and cleaning data project assignment and includes the following document:

1. run_analysis.R script which allows the reader to reproduce the results if necessary.
2. tidy.txt: the desired tidy data output file for the reader to check if they run the run_analysis.R script.
3. CodeBook.md: description of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
